"""
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

Example:

Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(NK)O(NK), where NN is the length of strs, and KK is the maximum length of a string in strs. Counting each string is linear in the size of the string, and we count every string.

Space Complexity: O(NK)O(NK), the total information content stored in ans.
