"""
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Explanation: It is required because defaultdict will return a defaultnode with value '0' by default. And we don't want a defaultvalue for None values.
For e.g.- for a case where there is a linkedlist like 1->2 and when we reach 2, dic[2].next=dic[2.next] is equal to dic[2].next=dic[None]
Here, if we don't put dic[None]=None, then we would get some default Node for dic[None] with value '0'. But we don't want that. Hope this helps.
